# trolddom-public
Gameplay code and content for the Trolddom game. These parts are released as Open Source under the MIT license. Note that this doesn't include all code, it just defines and implements all skills, maps, classes, NPCs, etc.

* ```include/```, ```lib/```: Here you'll find the C++ source code for various gameplay elements and for parsing and serializing data.
* ```data/```: All the data.
* ```util/```: Utility for parsing and verifying data.
* ```extra/```: Third-party source code.

## Huh, what?
You're more than welcome to come up with new stuff for the game. New classes, monsters, anything, or maybe just balance tweaks. Just submit a pull request and I'll try to integrate it into the game.
